# TagFS

## Concept
* Tag based structure instead of Tree
### Example
* A tree filesystem has a TV folder, containing 
  * Drama
  * Comedy
  * Animation
* You want to store Family Guy
  * Does Family Guy go in Comedy or Animation?
  * Both?
  
With a tag based filesystem you can apply tags to these files and they'll show up in both folders if moved to both folders. Deleting from one folder will remove the tag :^)


### Does it work?
no lol (not yet)
